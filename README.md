# üìò Monte Carlo Simulations for Option Pricing

This project applies Monte Carlo simulation to estimate prices for European call options, focusing on plain vanilla and binary cash-or-nothing payoffs. Given Monte Carlo's slow convergence, various variance reduction techniques are explored to improve accuracy and efficiency.

üîπ Key Features

-Monte Carlo Simulation for option pricing.
-Antithetic Variates to enhance convergence and accuracy.
-Weak-Euler Discretization to improve SDE approximations.
-Analysis of convergence speed for different techniques.

Through a series of simulations, these methods were shown to improve precision and computational efficiency. This repository contains Python implementations of these techniques, demonstrating their impact on Monte Carlo-based pricing models.

Two Discretisation methods were used to calculate the Call option prices using Monte Carlo Simulation -

- **Euler-Maruyama**(First Discretisation)
- **Geometric Brownian Motion**(Second Discretisation)

## üîß Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

You‚Äôll need **Python 3.x** installed. `pipenv` was used for easy dependency management.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your Virtual Environment

In your project folder, run:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

To install all required libraries:

```bash
pipenv install numpy scipy matplotlib mrg32k3a
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Everything is Set Up

```bash
pipenv graph
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Simulations

Each Python script explores different simulation techniques. Run them like this:

```bash
pipenv run python AFM_AntitheticVariate_BinaryCash.py
pipenv run python AFM_AntitheticVariate_Call.py
pipenv run python AFM_ControlVariate_BinaryCash.py
pipenv run python AFM_ControlVariate_Call.py
pipenv run python AFM_CW1_AntiPaths.py
pipenv run python AFM_Cw1_Cash.py
pipenv run python AFM_CW1_Euler.py
pipenv run python AFM_Cw1_SDE2_Csh.py
pipenv run python AFM_Cw1_SDE2.py
```
